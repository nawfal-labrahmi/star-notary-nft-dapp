## Decentralized Star Notary Service Project
This project is Dapp that relies on the functionality of a smart contract offering a star discovery notary service as non fungible tokens, ERC-721 compliant, based on an OpenZeppelin implementation of the standard. The token contrat is deployed on an Ethereum public testnet (Rinkeby).
This project is based on Truffle boxes (initialized by the webpack truffle box), and can be deployed on a local network (Ganache GUI or ganache-cli), or Rinkeby public testnet (See deployment configuration in truffle-config.js via the Infura API).
